 Introduction
===============
This document describes how to install and run the 
OpenMP/MPI mixed-mode microbenchmark suite.
It also gives a description of the source files and
modules of the code.

For more information see: 
http://www2.epcc.ed.ac.uk/~markb/mpiopenmpbench/intro.html
**** Link needs to be updated to point to new website when it is available ****

======================================================
Compiling
======================================================

A makefile is supplied with the code containing
build rules for each source file.

To compile for a particular system set the FC and
FFLAGS variables in the makefile.

Set CC to the Fortran compiler you want to use.

Add compiler flags you want to use to the CFLAGS 
variable.
These should include flags to process OpenMP directive
and MPI calls and also some standard optimisations. 

e.g.
FC=	mpicc
FFLAGS=	-mp -O3  

The code can then be compiled using the "make" 
command.


======================================================
Running
======================================================

An executable, mixedModeBenchmark, is produced after 
successful compilation.

The executable takes an input file as an argument:
e.g. mpiexec -np 4 ./mixedModeBenchmark inputFile

This contains benchmark setup information (min/max data 
size and benchmark target time) and a list 
of the benchmarks to be run.

A sample input file is shown below:

1 # min data size
4194304 # max data size
1.00 # target time
masteronlyPingpong 
0 1
funnelledPingpong
3 1
multiplePingpong
-1 0
funnelledHaloExchange
alltoall
gather
allReduce
barrier
scatter

For all pingpong and pingpong benchmarks the ranks of
participating MPI processes must be specified in the 
line following the benchmark name.
The number may be negative, in which case it is the 
offset from the last MPI process.
An offest of -1 is the last rank, numMPIprocs -1.
